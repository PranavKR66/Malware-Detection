# Malware-Detection
**The goal of this project is to detect malware using a dataset hosted by Microsoft on Kaggle.**

- **Performed exploratory data analysis in Pyspark on a data set consisting of 700,000 rows and 83 colums, using statistical analysis and visualization.**
- **Built a Decision Tree model and used it’s feature importance to perform feature selection.**
- **Implemented machine learning algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Naïve Bayes and Logistic Regression using the SparkML library to predict whether or not a machine has malware.**
- **Tuned hyper-parameters in order to optimize the Area under the curve (AUC) of the models. Made predictions with AUC values of around 66 percent.**
